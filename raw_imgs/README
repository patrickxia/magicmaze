These are some higher-resolution images that aren't used in
the deployed game but might make other things easier. I'm
uploading these after quite some time so who knows what format
they're in, which seems to be raster images in SVG format???

Note all online previewers of SVG don't seem to open these files.
You'll need Inkscape or something similar.
